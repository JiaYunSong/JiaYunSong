# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹  


I'm passionate about coding and poetry, and you'll often find me spending entire days in the library. If we share these interests, then we're indeed fortunate to cross paths!

 
I have experience with various programming languages and frameworks, including C, C++, C#, .NET, MFC, Qt5, UWP, Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, R, Kafka, MongoDB, and WxApp. My background includes contributing to multiple collaborative projects, and I believe I can integrate well into any team environment.

 
Professionally, I specialize in deep learning techniques within the image domain, including object detection, depth estimation, and pose estimation. I have also explored complex event processing, machine learning, brain-computer interfaces, and IoT control. My machine learning focus includes CNN, LSTM, SVM, DCRNN, CDPN, and more. Iâ€™m always up for an academic discussion, so feel free to reach out!
